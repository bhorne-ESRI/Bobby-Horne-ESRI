        <p>Recreational areas would include land that is designed, constructed, designated, or used for recreational
          activities. Examples are national, state, county, or city parks, other outdoor recreational areas such as golf
          courses or swimming pools and bodies of waters (oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams) when used by the public
          for fishing, swimming, or boating. Public and private areas that are predictably used for hunting, fishing,
          bird watching, bike riding, hiking, or camping or other recreational use also would be considered recreational
          areas.</p>
