They need explicit instructions in order to solve a problem. This means that when we, as programmers, are presented with a problem, we have to provide the computer a complete set of instructions for it to do what we want.

It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Most of the code you right in IDEs are color coded, which helps you generally while also serving as indicator for incorrectly written code. \n","\n","An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the necessary tools developers need to write and test algorithms or applications for various types of computing platforms. An IDE is a central interface featuring all tools a developer needs, including the following:<br>\n","\n","* Code editor: This feature is a text editor designed for writing and editing source code. \n","* Compiler: This tool transforms source code written in a human readable/writable language into a form executable by a computer.\n","* Debugger: This tool is used during testing to help debug application programs.\n","* Build automation tools: These tools automate common developer tasks\n","\n","The courses use the Jupyter Notebook IDE as an aid to quickly develop Python software applications.  <br>There are other IDEs commonly used in the development of Python based applications. These IDEs are:\n","* IDLE \n","* Spyder\n","* PyCharm\n","* Sublime Text 3 \n","* Visual Studio Code\n","\n","### (U) 1.2.2 Jupyter Notebook\n","#### (U) Orientation\n","The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Jupyter Notebook is maintained by the people at Project Jupyter. The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which allows you to write your programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that you can also use. \n","\n","Jupyter Notebook supports adding rich content to its cells. In this section, you will get an overview of just some of the things you can do with your cells using Markup and Code.\n","\n","Learning to navigate Jupyter will help you write Python code in Jupyter. \n","This course is being delivered using Jupyter Notebook. You will not be required on creating any material similar for this course or lesson. This will serve as a general familiarization and ends with a \n","\n","#### (U) *Buttonology*\n","The Menus <br>\n","The Jupyter Notebook has several menus that you can use to interact with your Notebook. The menus runs along the top of the Notebook just like menus do in other applications. \n","\n","There are three menus at the top:<br>\n","\n","**Row 1**<br>\n","Add | Analysis | Code Snippets | Files | Tasks | Snapshots | Share | Info <br>\n","\n","**Row 2**<br>\n","File | Edit | View | Insert | Cell | Kernel | Help  <br>\n","\n","**Row 3**<br>\n","Plus Sign | Cut | Paste Cells Below | Move Cells Up or Down | Run | Stop | Restart Kernel | Restart Kernal pt 2 | Cell Type Dropdown | Slideshow<br>\n","\n","Let’s briefly cover row 2 options, one by one.\n","\n","- **File menu:** In it, you can create a new Notebook or open a preexisting one. This is also where you would go to rename a Notebook. I think the most interesting menu item is the Save and Checkpoint option. This allows you to create checkpoints that you can roll back to if you need to.\n","\n","- **Edit menu:** Here you can cut, copy, and paste cells. This is also where you would go if you wanted to delete, split, or merge a cell. You can reorder cells here too.\n","\n"," - Note that some of the items in this menu are greyed out. The reason for this is that they do not apply to the currently selected cell. For example, a code cell cannot have an image inserted into it, but a Markdown cell can. If you see a greyed out menu item, try changing the cell’s type and see if the item becomes available to use.\n","\n","- **View menu:** is useful for toggling the visibility of the header and toolbar. You can also toggle Line Numbers within cells on or off. This is also where you would go if you want to mess about with the cell’s toolbar.\n","\n","- **Insert menu:** is just for inserting cells **above or below** the currently selected cell.\n","\n","- **Cell menu:** \n"," - allows you to **run** or **clear** one cell, a group of cells, or all the cells. You can also go here to change a cell’s **type**.\n","\n"," - Cell Types\n","   - There are technically four cell types but you'll only use two: \n","    - The **Code** cell is where you can write code to execute within Jupyter. \n","    - The **Markdown** cell is where you can design your notebook appearnce. We code some markdown later in the guided and practical exercises\n","    \n","- **The Kernel Menu** \n","- is for working with the kernel that is running in the background. Here you can restart the kernel, reconnect to it, shut it down, or even change which kernel your Notebook is using. Under the hood, Jupyter Notebook has a Python _kernel_ that stores the variables you've created and remembers what libraries you've imported.  The kernel can only run one code cell at a time, but everything stored in the kernel is available anywhere inside your Jupyter Notebook. Splitting up code into different cells allows you to view outputs at every step. You'll view this later during the guided exercise and practical exercises. \n","\n"," - You probably won’t be working with the Kernel all that often, but there are times when you are debugging a Notebook that you will find you need to restart the Kernel. When that happens, this is where you would go.\n","\n","- **Widgets menu** is for saving and clearing widget state. Widgets are basically JavaScript widgets that you can add to your cells to make dynamic content using Python (or another Kernel).\n","\n","- **Help menu** , which is where you go to learn about the Notebook’s keyboard shortcuts, a user interface tour, and lots of reference material.\n","\n","\n","Lastly, is the **<u>SAVE</u>** drop-down Menu. Notebook doesn't automatically Save your progress. You have to manually Save your work through the drop-down, or through a shortcut ```CRTL + S```\n","\n","#### (U) Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts\n","- Let's check out some of the functionality built into Jupyter Notebooks. There are a number of keyboard shortcuts that work in Jupyter Notebook. You can find a complete list of shortcuts by clicking the keyboard button in the menu above. Here are some general shortcuts for your reference.<br>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","\n","| Shortcut | Description| Shortcut | Description|\n","|:---:|---:|:---:|:---:|\n","| **Shift + Enter**| Execute the contents of the cell, and move to the next cell |  **Enter** | enter Edit Mode |\n","| **Ctrl + Enter** | Execute the contents of the cell, but stay with this cell| **Alt + Enter** | Execute Cell, insert a new cell below |\n","| **Esc** | enter Command Mode | **m** | Convert a cell to Markdown|\n","| **y** | Convert a cell to Code| **l** | Display line numbers in the selected cell|\n","| **a** | Insert a cell above the selected cell| **b** | Insert a cell below the selected cell|\n","| **c** | Copy the selected cell| **x** | Cut the selected cell|\n","| **v** | Paste cell below the selected cell| **dd** | Delete selected cell |\n","| **z** | Undo a cell deletion | **Up Arrow** | Highlight the cell above |\n","| **Down Arrow** | Highlight the cell below|\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","#### (U) Markdown\n","- **Styling Your Text**\n"," - Jupyter Notebook supports Markdown, which is a markup language that is a superset of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML is used extensively on web page design. It can be extremely tideous to write a webpage. Markdown simplifies this language, borrowing some of the standard formatting tags used in HTML. An HTML or Markdown tag is a character followed that is encapsulated within greater than or less than signs \"<>\", i.e.<br>\n"," \n","```<b>Tags that will Bold Font </b>```\n","<br>\n","1. Notice that the alligator mouth of the great than less than symbols face towards the letter or character\n","1. The left tag is considered the opening tag.\n","1. The right tag is considered the closing tag. *notice that the closing tag contains a foward slash. This lets the computer know to stop the formatting tag.<br>\n","\n","There are a host of other HTML tags that you can use within Jupyter Notebooks. <a href= \"https://htmlcheatsheet.com/\" target= \"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> HTML Reference.</a>\n","\n","Mastering HTML is not the focus of this court.

This is your copy. We're going to talk about it shortly, before I release you compelte your first guided exercise. \n","\n","Overall, you/we will likely not complete all the exercises in this book, while in this class. That's ok. This class is available online via AGOL. The book, is enitrely unclassified. We will not do anything that is classified in this course. Everything you learn will be free to leave the classroom. That means, that if you fall behind some of your other classmates, you are free to take your materials and work outside of this classroom.\n","\n","HOWEVER, you will need to be in this classroom during the designated times in order to receive a completion certificate. You will be dropped from this class for repeated absenses. \n","\n","The SW in front of you contains a varitey of information and exercises. You'll find your syllabus, course schedule, and definitions for the type of exercises.  \n","\n","Overall, each day will likely begin with a lecture using this Jupyter Notebook you are viewing right now (on the screen).\n","After the lecture, the class will be released to their computers to begin exercises. There are 5 exercise types in this course:\n","\n","Instructor-led Exercises (ILE)\n","Open-book Exercises (OBE)\n","Identify Components Exercises (IDE)\n","Computational Thinking Exercises (CTE)\n","Solution Development Exercises (SDE)\n","\n","Let's get some volunteers to read the definitions, followed by a discussion if there are any questions. \n","\n","BREAK\n","\n","Exercises are also broken down by module, and numbered according. The intent is to help students progressively train what was discused, and prorvide a mechanism for the student and instructor to communicate assistance.\n","\n","The type of exercise is listed in your workbooks before you begin working on the exercises. This will help you understand the intent of the exercise type, before you begin. \n","\n","Someone read the passage in the workbook, after the definitions. \n","\n","When appropriate, I will notify you when its time to start working in your notebooks. When I do, I will let you know how much time you have to complete the exercises. The time might not be enough to complete all the exercises. Just like I said, that's ok. There will be time you can make up the work. I have to make sure we cover all of the instuctional material. \n","\n","The course will culimate with two capstones that coincide with the intent of the course. \n","1. The first and most important goal is to update/modify a given script to execute successfully. \n","1. The second objective of this course is to an application that executes successfully. The application will have some requirements that you'll have to include, but overall the difficulty and length of the script you write is entirely up to you. \n","\n","Now that we've navigated what the course looks, the materials you'll use, and the other admin stuff. Let'd do our first exercise together.

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).\n","\n","Python is named after Monty Python's Flying Circus. The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document The Zen of Python, which includes aphorisms such as:\n","\n","* Beautiful is better than ugly\n","* Explicit is better than implicit\n","* Simple is better than complex\n","* Complex is better than complicated\n","* Readability counts\n","\n","\n","## <b><u>(U) Lesson Terminal Learning Objective (TLO) </b></u> <br>\n","<font size=4>(U) <i><u>**Explain** Python Knowledge and Vocabulary Basics for:</u><br>\n","> (1)\t(U) Data Types <br>\n","(2)\t(U) Operators <br>\n","(3)\t(U) Expressions <br>\n","(4)\t(U) Functions and Arguments <br>\n","(5)\t(U) Casting Data Types <br>\n","(6)\t(U) Common Operations <br> \n","(7)\t(U) Errors <br>\n","</i></font>\n","\n","<font size=4> <i><u>(U) **Formulate** error-free syntax using Python Knowledge and Vocabulary Basics for:</u> <br>\n",">(1)\t(U) Data Types<br>\n","(2)\t(U) Operators<br>\n","(3)\t(U) Expressions<br>\n","(4)\t(U) Functions and Arguments<br>\n","(5)\t(U) Casting Data Types<br>\n","(6)\t(U) Common Operations <br>\n","(7)\t(U) Errors<br>\n","</i></font>\n","\n","***\n","####  (U )Python 5W's content reference https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/learn-python/what-is-python\n","\n","##### What is Python? \n","There are just about as many programming and scripting languages as there are lanugages for the spoken word across the world.  \n","\n","Python was chosen becuase it is relatively simple, so it’s easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on **readability**. Developers can read and translate Python code much easier than other languages. In turn, this reduces the cost of program maintenance and development because it allows teams to work collaboratively without significant language and experience barriers. Python environments are also very accessible on all PoR equipmet and systems for every classification platform within the Army. It is accessible on your GEOINT systems. \n","\n","In technical terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. \n"," \n","Additionally, Python supports the use of modules and packages, which means that programs can be designed in a modular style and code can be reused across a variety of projects. Once you’ve developed a module or package you need, it can be scaled for use in other projects, and it’s easy to import or export these modules.\n"," \n","One of the most promising benefits of Python is that both the standard library and the interpreter are available free of charge, in both binary and source form. There is no exclusivity either, as Python and all the necessary tools are available on all major platforms. Therefore, it is an enticing option for developers who don’t want to worry about paying high development costs.\n"," \n","If this description of Python over your head, don’t worry. You’ll understand it soon enough. What you need to take away from this section is that Python is a programming language used to develop software on the web and in app form, including mobile. It’s relatively easy to learn, and the necessary tools are available to all free of charge.\n"," \n","That makes Python accessible to almost anyone. If you have the time to learn, you can create some amazing things with the language.\n","\n","Python is a general-purpose programming language, which is another way to say that it can be used for nearly everything. Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format at runtime. Whereas, most programming languages do this conversion before the program is even run. This type of language is also referred to as a “scripting language” because it was initially meant to be used for trivial projects.\n"," \n","The concept of a “scripting language” has changed considerably since its inception, because Python is now used to write large, commercial style applications, instead of just banal ones. This reliance on Python has grown even more so as the internet gained popularity. A large majority of web applications and platforms rely on Python, including Google’s search engine, YouTube, and the web-oriented transaction system of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). You know the language must be pretty serious when it’s powering a stock exchange system.\n"," \n","In fact, NASA actually uses Python when they are programming their equipment and space machinery. Pretty neat, right?\n","\n","##### Benefits \n","\n","1. Python can be used to develop prototypes, and quickly because it is so easy to work with and read.\n","1. Most automation, data mining, and big data platforms rely on Python. This is because it is the ideal language to work with for general purpose tasks.\n","1. Python allows for a more productive coding environment than massive languages like C# and Java. Experienced coders tend to stay more organized and productive when working with Python, as well.\n","1. Python is easy to read, even if you’re not a skilled programmer. Anyone can begin working with the language, all it takes is a bit of patience and a lot of practice. Plus, this makes it an ideal candidate for use among multi-programmer and large development teams.\n","1. It has a massive support base thanks to the fact that it is open source and community developed. Millions of like-minded developers work with the language on a daily basis and continue to improve core functionality. The latest version of Python continues to receive enhancements and updates as time progresses. This is a great way to network with other developers.\n","\n","\n","##### Versions\n","\n","Just like with every other technological computer device, Python, and all other languages for that matter have publish updates or **VERSIONS**. In this course, we're using Python3.0. This means that function or methods from previous versions may have been removed or altered. This is referred to as Deprication. In any event, this is an important consideration to make prior to starting a project, or providing a solution built on a specific version of Python. \n","\n","#### 1.3.4 (U) Syntax Components:  Expressions \n","Computer programming lanugages require literal **statements** or **expressions** that are passed to the computer to read and execute. \n","\n","In its simplist form, an expression is something that has a variable, an operator, and value.\n","\n","An expression or statement can be as simple as: \n","- n = 10\n","- camel = n + 12 + sqrt(5)\n","\n","But, expressions can be more complex, more compounded: \n","- rc_h = Con((wh > 0) & (bh  == 0), 1, Con((bh > 0) & (wh > 0),wh/ (wh  + bh)))\n","- for row in cursor:\n","    row[1] = (row[0] / areaCount) * 100\n","    cursor.updateRow(row)\n","\n","These statements are <b>instructions</b> a programmer or developer writes to accomplish a given task. Computer programming statements have a specific structure and rules, just like writing a sentence for someone to read in an email, or a blog post. Each individual computer programming language is unique, and requires an understanding of that languages rules, this is very much similar to the various spoken languages across the world. Learning the components of the spoken word helps to learn other spoken languages, i.e. verbs, subjects, nouns, etc. Programming and scripting languages have components that translate to other languages also, providing some commonality across the spectrum of computer languages. \n","\n","In this section, we're going to focus on those components in this lesson. Understanding these are crucile because it forms the basis for **instructing** the computer to accomplish tasks. \n","\n","To continue with our previuos analogly, Statements or expressions are written using rules or guidelines known as **syntax**, such as the spoken/written languages refer to this as <u>grammar</u>. **Syntax** - refers to how you write code, such as spacing, punctuation, and indentation.  Python depends on correct syntax to properly read and execute the code you write.  A single mistake in syntax will cause Python to execute the code differently than you intended or to throw an error, meaning Python will stop running your code and then give you an error message describing what went wrong. \n","\n","The difference between computer programming syntax and spoken or written languages grammar is that you can likely still maintain communication if you put a comma incorrectly in a written English sentence. \n","\n","For example:<br>\n","<u> Communicating in Written Word </u> \n","\n","Dog barked cat ran *not grammatically correct, but one can understand what happened.*\n","\n","The dog barked and the cat ran. *Grammtically correct, readable, and would pass a proofreader edits. \n","\n","However, computers cannot infer meaning when writing code (unless code is writted to address that - think internet search engines). When you are developing statements and expressions to execute any computer programming languages, your grammar or **SYNTAX** must be error free. We will talk about errors more in a later seciton. \n","\n","For example:<br>\n","<u> Instruction a Computer with Syntax </u> "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["10\n"]}],"source":["#Simple syntax or expression, that is defining n as a variable, with a value of 10, and printing it. \n","n 10\n","print(n)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["h=\"harris\"\n","\"h\" in h\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":["# Simple sytax that is defining n as a variable, with a value of 10, and printing it.\n","n = 10 # Must define variable using a operator\n","print(n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":["#Simple sytax that is defining n as a variable, with a value of 10, and printing it. \n","n = 10 # Must define variable using a operator\n","print(n) # Was missing the end parenthesis"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now that we've discussed the importance of **expressions** with appropriate **SYNTAX**, were going to move on to defining each component of an expresions in more detail. \n","\n","####  (U) Variables (Global and Local?), Data Types, Operators (arithmatic/comparison)\n","Variables, Data types, and Operators are the core components and consideratoiins that construct majority of an expression.  \n","\n","##### <u>Variables</u>\n","Variables are blank objects that are assigned a value, at the time you create them, or later through programmatic means. A variable is assigned a value using the equal sign \" = \". Simply, the developer provides a label or name with any letter, number, and some special character combination and , i.e. 'purple', 'a_1', 'ihateprogramming.' **You cannot use spaces in between variable names like 'a 1', 'i hate programming'** \n","\n","When naming variables, there are some considerations to help with programming structure and readability. \n","\n","1.

Variables are not limited to values, they can also hold other data objects, such as Lists and Arrays, or other structured data objects. We'll cover Unstructured and Structured Data Objects later in the course. Naming variables and How you assign values to variables is the same, no matter what the variable holds. \n","\n","1. Constant Variables - Constant variables are created with intent of them not chnaging. They are defined upfront, at module level, and served as feeders into additonal equations or algorithms. This is the same as any other math constant in a equation, i.e.  Area = ½ × b × h. The 1/2 is a constant variable that will not change.  \n","\n","1. Non-Constant Variables - Non-Constant variables change. They can typically be altered throughout a script, if the solution requires it. The only restrictions for changing a variables value is it's scope.\n","- Variable Scope - programmatic access to variables can be controlled using 4 variables: Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-In. We won't cover these extensively, and will primarily only create Global variables. \n","\n","Developers can assign values to the non-constant variables through two methods: hard coding or programmatically \n","- Hard Coding Variable Assignment: Discrete assignment of a value: `x = 4` `dataL = annual`\n","\n","- Programmatic Variable Assignment: A developer can establish a blank variable as a place holder and fill it later. Additionally, a variable can also refence another variable with value, if desired. This is uncommon, but might serve some purpose in the future. \n","`x = ` `dataL = ` `x = dataL`\n","\n","- Once established or instantiated, variables are often called *objects*.\n","\n","Before we begin our Guided and Practical Exercises, we have to cover two additional topics: Operators and Data Types. \n","\n","<a id=\"Operators\"></a>\n","##### <u> 1.3.3 Operators used in Python</u>\n","Don't think of Operators in the Army sense, instead think of mathematical equalities.

A Python program will get confused if you tell it to add `'one'`, which is text, and `2`, which is a number.  People can make the mental leap that `'one'` also means the numeric value `1`, but a computer program cannot make this leap on its own. It can sometimes be difficult to know the type of a data object just by looking at it. Remember, the computers are not able to infer meaning (not completely), so developes use directions that must abide by certain rules. Data types are one set of rules. \n","\n","There are many data types in Python, but to keep things simple, we will begin by covering the basics: Boolean, integer, float, string, and the None Type. See the table below for short descriptions of these basic data types. \n","\n","| Plain Language Description                              | Python Data Type | `type()` Output |\n","| :------------------------------------------ | :---------------: | :-------------: |\n","| True or False                               | Boolean          | `bool`            |\n","| Whole Numbers                               | Integer          | `int`             |\n","| Decimal Numbers                             | Float            | `float`           |\n","| Sequences of characters including letters, <br>numbers, formatting characters, and/or punctuation   | String   | `str` |\n","| Nothingness, non-existence; not the same as <br>zero or empty                 | None          | `NoneType`            |\n","\n","<u>Boolean</u>\n","\n","A Boolean can only be one of two values: `True` or `False`.  These values can be explicitly defined or defined as the result of an expression. Any Python object can be included in a Boolean expression.  For example, if the variable `x` was assigned the value of `35`, then the expression `x > 40` (i.e. is `x` greater than `40`?) would evaluate to `False`.  \n","\n","This ability to compare and contrast one value against another is very important in computer programming.   It allows computers to execute, or not execute, a task based on a condition.  You can think of Booleans as your program's way of responding to yes-or-no questions. Can you think of an instance when you would need to ask your program a question, and execute different commands based on its answer?\n","\n","In Jupyter Notebook code cells, you will see the capitalized words `True` and `False` always show up colored green and bold because they are reserved words in Python. Recall that each reserved word has a specific purpose in Python code and cannot be used for any other purpose.\n","A Boolean value can also be created with a Boolean expression. There are several types of Boolean expressions. The first type we'll learn about are comparisons.\n","\n","</u> Numbers (Integers and Floats) Arithmetic Operators</u>\n","\n","The difference between integers and floats is the decimal point, which is sometimes called a floating point. Integers are whole numbers and do not include a decimal point. Even in a number like like `2.0`, the presence of a decimal makes it a float. However, Python treats equivalent numbers as equal even if they are of different types.#### Casting\n","\n","We can convert other data types to integers and floats using the `int()` and `float()` functions.  Using these functions to change a value's data type is called casting. Other data types have their own functions for casting data objects. In the code cell below, notice how we have to cast the string `'4'` to an integer so that we can calculate the perimeter of a triangle.\n","Python will evaluate arithmetic expressions in the order P,E,M/D,AS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (floor division, modulus), then addition and subtraction. For groupings of multiplication and division, as well as for groupings of addition and subtraction, the order is based on position and works from left to right. Work through the formula/expression below to understand how it produces the result, then run it to check if you were right.\n","\n","</u> Strings </u>\n","\n","Strings are immutable sequences of zero or more characters. In Python 3, strings can include extended character sets such as Unicode. Example Unicode characters are shown below. Strings are always wrapped in quotation marks. We can use single quotes (`''`), double quotes (`\"\"`), or three sets of quotation marks often called triple quotes (`\"\"\" \"\"\"`).\n","\n","</u> None Type </u>\n","\n","The None data type only has one possible value, `None`, which is used to indicate the absence of data. `None` is not the same as zero, an empty list, or an empty string. The `None` type is used to indicate an empty cell in a table or spreadsheet. As we move forward in the course, we will find that some functions make use of the `None` type when they do not need to \"return\" a value. \n","\n","<a id='Boolean'></a>\n","\n","Now that we've discused all the compenents of a Pythonic expression, let's work thorugh some of them together and follow it with individual practical exercises. \n","\n","#### Lesson 1.3.3 Summary\n","In this section of lesson 1.3, we've focused on the compenents required to write code and in Python.

Functions (or methods) and Arguments (or Parameters)\n","\n","* **Function** or **Method** - Think of functions and methods as little programs or apps.  They are bodies of code that take specified input(s), do some actions (even running other functions), and then usually provide some output.  You can think of every computer program you use (i.e., Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, Super Mario, etc.) as a group of functions that work together to carry out all of the things the program does. Function or methods are synominous, and can be used interchangably. \n","\n","The name of a Python function is always followed by parentheses; it's the easiest way to identify a function in code.  The input(s) for a function or method go inside of those parentheses. \n","```print()``` ```INSERT.METHOD()```\n","\n","* **Arguments** or **Parameters** - These are just the technical terms for the inputs that a function or method takes.  Some functions and methods require certain input(s), while others require no inputs. `'Hello world!'` is the argument for `print()`.<br>\n","\n","* **Library** - A library is a collection of code that defines certain methods and may also define the nature of special data types. Where do libraries come from?  They are written by programmers and shared with others, usually online. A **package** is a synonym for library. In order to use a library, you must call ```import``` the library in order to use any of the functions. \n","\n","As of now, there are roughly 130,000 libraries that solve all sorts of problem sets. Some are relevant, and some are <a href= https://medium.com/swlh/6-fun-weird-python-packages-to-keep-you-entertained-during-the-quarantine-257a84261c91 target= \"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> weird</a>. We'll use access and employ functions from other libraries later in the course.  \n","\n","* **Modules** - A module is a collection of code that is within a library. For example, Python has a over 200 Modules within an install of Python. This differs from a library in that a library is external to a the core programming lanuguage's installation of code. MathPlotLib is a popular Python library that must be installed on your system in order to access it's functions or methods. \n","\n","<u> A Simple Function and Arguments Example:</u>\n","\n","Python has specific **String** functions that can be applied to manipulate strings.

They show up as green and bold inside Jupyter Notebook code cells. The keyword library has a list of all Python's keywords.\n","\n","##### Common or Built-In Functions\n","\n","You will also notice that some words show up as light green (as opposed to bold green) when you type them into a code cell.  These are built-in functions (i.e., functions that come prepackaged for you with your version of Python). Built-in Functions and Modules have very similar definitions, and the distinction is that they perform common operations or access to more informaiton regarding Python or parts your code.   \n","\n","Here are some examples of built-in functions.\n","```python\n","print() - Prints output that are either messages or value-based outputs. \n","type()  - Identifies a variables data type, if unknown. \n","help()  - Provides in-screen access to help menu to navigate programmtically. Similar to hitting the help button on any GUI. If an argument is passed into the `help()` function (such as `math`), the documentation for that topic will be printed. The `help()` function works with imported libraries as well as keywords and built-in functions. Not the most easily read refernce. \n","```\n","Unlike reserved words, Python will let you re-assign built-in function names to other values, <i>but you should not do this</i>. Once you re-assign a function's name to something else, you lose the ability to use that function, which is bad because these functions are fundamental to some core Python capabilities. Never do something like the following.

At first, error messages can be discouraging because it signifies that something isn't working properly. However, after awhile you'll realize that errors are just reminders *(sometimes constant)* that you forgot some part of your code. They tell you what went wrong so you know what to fix in your code. \n","\n","Error messages won't harm or break your script, but Python will stop executing code when it throws an error message. And it forces you to find or fix before it will execute your tasks.\n","\n","Evenutally, you will learn how to create your own error messages (why though?!) to help users of your solution figure out how they are using your tools incorrectly. \n","\n","####  (U)  Coding Style (Talk about comments too.)\n","\n","Coding style is a general term for how your code looks, how its formatted, and how you use comments. Basically, it considers all of the topics we discussed so far. You'll eventaully begin to create your style, and code the same way as you continually write code.\n","\n","The PEP8 Style Guide for Python is a fairly short web document.  Although your Python code is not being graded for style in this course, it is a good practice to adhere to the Python Style Guide if only to increase the readability of your code by others, especially if you are seeking their help to solve a problem. Regardless of whether you adhere to a style guide or not, **try to be consistent in your code**.\n","\n","* **Comment** - A comment is text that is ignored by the computer. It is a description that provides more information about the thought process or logic that the code is representing. Any text that follows a pound sign (`#`) in a line of code will be considered a comment, and will not be evaluated by the computer. This allows us to leave notes for ourselves and other developers to reference.\n","```# This is a comment```\n","\n","Notes are extremely important to help you keep track of your progress during development of a script.

It is just a virtual database that developers have the ability to create, control, and access. Programmtically, we distinguish data structures (or databases) by if they are ordered or unordered. There are specific functions built to work with each type of data structure we cover today, while there are some common functions that apply to all structures. We'll cover some built-in functions designed to navigate through any size database. \n","\n","Data structures differ by how they are used, how efficient they are at storing data (think compressed vs uncompressed), how they are accessed, and whether or not you can change them. Changing items in a data structure is referred to as mutability, data structures are either mutable (changeable) or immutable (cannot change). Each data stucture has different functions that you read or write with. Each data structure is unique, and only applicable for certain uses. \n","\n","Lastly, accessing data structures requires familiarity with conditional statements, loops, and counter objects. We've already coded a few basic ```if``` statements. However, ```if``` statements become more complex, and are often used with loops and counter objects.

As they are created and appended, entries are stored in the next available slot. Think of ordered data structures as logs or diaries. Entries are sequential, so it is important to know that when you are creating or accessing them. \n","\n","Ordered Structures are in a **sequence**. \n","\n","A sequence in Python is an ordered grouping of elements.  Each element in a sequence is assigned an index, which is a number that marks its place in the sequence. The first item in a Python sequence has index `[0]`, the second has index `[1]`, and so on. Note that Python supports negative indexing too, with the last element in the sequence having the index `[-1]`. That means each element in a sequence can be accessed with two indexes, a positive one and a negative one.\n","\n","There are two primary ordered data structures that you'll use in this course: The *list*, the *tuple*, and *the array*, but we'll cover that bit later. \n","\n","## <b><u>(U) Lesson 2.1: Ordered Data Structures </b></u><br>\n","## <b><u>(U) Lesson Terminal Learning Objective (TLO) </b></u> <br>\n","<font size=4>(U)<i><u> **Summarize**</u> the differences in use-cases for Python Data structures</i></font> <br>\n","<font size=4>(U)<i><u> **Construct** </u> error-free syntax to create Python Data Structures </i></font> <br>\n","<font size=4>(U)<i><u> **Inspect, Compare, and Modify**</u> Python Data structures programmatically.</i> </font> <br>\n","\n","#### References:\n","* [Python: Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n","* [Python: More on Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)\n","* [Effbot: An Introduction to Python Lists](http://www.effbot.org/zone/python-list.htm)\n","\n","#### (U) Mutable vs. Immutable\n","\n","Before we move on, it is important to discuss mutability.

Like all sequences, items in a tuple are accessible by a numeric index. Like all immutable objects, tuples will not allow you to add, subtract, or edit items without overwriting the entire structure. This makes tuples nice for storing data that you don't want to be edited piecemeal, such as coordinate pairs or days of the week. If thereâ€™s something you donâ€™t want to change, making that fact explicit by not allowing it to change is best practice. Tuples are always wrapped in parentheses: `()` \n","\n","Tuples are also a sequenced data structure, just like lists. However, tuples are immutable; you cannot add, delete, or change items after a tuple is created.

The main difference is that a list can hold multiple different data types in a list, i.e.```list1 = [\"string\", \"2\", \"2.0\"]```\n","\n","Conversely, an array holds the same data type and is defined when an array is instantiated. \n","\n","```arrayName = array.array(dataType, [array items])```\n","\n","Arrays are unique because they can be \"1-2-3-n\" dimensional. This makes them, like a list of lists. \n","\n","Think about an arrays like a programmtic version of Excel.\n","\n","- A 1-D array is essentially a singular row of values. \n","- A 2-D array is an array of arrays (multiple rows and multiple columns).

It is important to know what that is because it impacts how you build and exploit (mutability) them.

This means that indexing and slicing functions are not availabe. The two unordered data were going to cover are Sets and Dictionaries.\n","\n","Sequences are like pill boxes.  They contain pieces of data in a given order, where each item is given a numeric index.\n","\n","Unordered collections, on the other hand, are like pill bottles.  While they also contain data elements, there is not an inherent order or addressing system.\n","\n","<a id=\"Sets\"></a>\n","#### 2.2.1Sets\n","\n","\n","Sets are mutable, unordered collections of unique elements. Like all unordered collections, sets are not considered sequences and do not support indexing or slicing. Sets also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Basic uses of sets include membership testing and deduplication. Sets are always wrapped in curly braces: `{}`\n","\n","#### (U) Creating Sets\n","\n","There's only one way to create an empty set, and that is to call the `set()` function with no arguments. To create a set with elements in it, wrap multiple elements in curly braces.\n","\n","To add elements to a set, use the `.add()` method. To remove individual elements from a set, use the `.remove()` method.\n","\n","| Syntax               | Description                               |\n","|:----------------------:|-------------------------------------------|\n","|`set_variable.add(x)`  | Adds `x` to the set |\n","|`set_variable.remove(x)`| Removes `x` from the set |\n","|`set_variable.pop()`| Removes and returns a random item from the set |\n","\n","<a id=\"Dictionaries\"></a>\n","\n","### (U) 2.2.2 Dictionaries\n","\n","Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Unlike sequences, which are indexed, dictionaries are accessible by their keys, which can be of any immutable type. Strings, numbers, and tuples can all serve as keys in a dictionary.\n","\n","Dictionaries share many properties with sets:\n","* Both sets and dictionaries are unordered\n","* Both sets and dictionaries are wrapped in curly braces\n","* Sets must have unique entries, dictionaries must have unique keys\n","\n","A driver's license is a great example of a common object in our daily lives that uses key-value pairs. Each data point is linked to a key that describes what it is. \n","\n","#### (U) Creating Dictionaries\n","Like sets, dictionaries use curly braces as wrappers. However, a set of empty curly braces gets interpreted as an empty dictionary, not a set. We can also set up a dictionary that's populated with entries. Note that each entry in the dictionary below is a pair of values separated by a colon (`:`). To the left of the colon is the entry's _key_, and to the right is the _value_. Dictionary entries are always structured like this: `key: value`, with commas separating each `key: value` pair.\n","\n","#### (U) Dict Methods and Operations\n","\n","To access a value inside a dictionary, we use bracket notation as we would for a list, tuple, or string. But instead of putting a numeric index inside the brackets, we put a key. Dictionaries are mutable, so we can change individual values without overwriting the entire data structure.\n","\n","| Syntax                 | Description                               |\n","|:----------------------:|-------------------------------------------|\n","| `dict_variable[key]` |Accesses the item at key `[key]` |\n","| `dict_variable[key] = x` |Sets the item at key `[key]` to  `x` |\n","\n","> NOTE: Dictionary keys can be any immutable data type.\n","\n","<a id=\"CommonOPsDS\"></a>\n","###  Common Operations Across Data Structures\n","\n","There are certain operations you can do on any collection of data we cover in this course.

Unstructured datasets in Python are objects that store any amount of data in the computers memory. These datasets have different punctuation to instantiate them and different functions to work with them. Each datastructure type has a purpose, or an appropriate use. It is important to know what that is because it impacts how you build and exploit (mutability) them.

This is especially true regarding data structures. \n","\n","Conditional statements are space senstive, or indentation senseiitve, and also punctionally senseitve too. Python, and other languages differ in that regard. The number of spaces or indentation is something to be aware of while programming in general, but very important regarding conditional statements. Luckily, IDEs, (who remembers what and IDE is?) handle most of the mundane tasks like spacing, they recognize when they are used and ensure that your following lines are in compliance. We'll exemplify this later in the guided exercise. \n","\n","## <b><u>(U) Lesson Terminal Learning Objective (TLO) </b></u> <br>\n","<font size=4>(U)<i><u> **Construct** </u> Conditional statements that apply selection criteria to Python Data Structures.</i></font> <br>\n","\n","### (U) Conditional Statements, The ```If```\n","\n","Conceptually, conditional statements are not difficult to grasp. We use them all the time in real life. \n","\n","For example, we humans are fairly habitual. When I go to lunch, where I work, there are about eight places to eat. I generally have three courses of action, depending on how busy things are. \n","1st - I'll go to the WoW chicken becuase they have great chicken tenders and the cheapest fries in the building. \n","2nd - I'll go to the custom sandwich stand because submay is always packed, and generally the bread selection is much better at the sandwich place. \n","3rd - I'll go get a slice of pizza from the brick oven pizzeria because its thin crust, cooked in a brick oven, and really good for the price. \n","\n","My decisions for lunch are conditions.

Say the database included a month's worth of data for each person on this list. Well we'd have over 450 entries of data (15 people x 30 days of records). If we used the same approach as the last, writing 3 lines of code per person, that would equal like 1,450 lines of code (most ```if``` statements). pretty sure my math is right. This gets more complicated if our criteria for number of people in line changes daily. \n","\n","Using Loops and counter objects is a more sophisticated way to approach to solve this problem. Writing a code elegantly takes time, but with practice, you'll see how incorporate more succinct programs.

Python has a statement called a `for` loop that steps through a data collection, and allows you to execute code on its individual elements. A `for` loop allows us to, for example, run a set of `if` blocks on each of the data points in a large data set. The following is a template for a `for` loop in Python.\n","\n","```python\n","for item in collection:\n","    do_something()\n","```\n","\n","### (U)  While Loops\n","\n","#### References:\n","* [Python: The while statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)\n","* [TutorialsPoint: Python - Loops](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm) \n","\n","The `while` loop repeats while a given Boolean test expression is `True`. The `while` loop tests the Boolean test expression before executing the loop body.\n","\n","The code below shows an example `while` loop. Once the Boolean expression becomes `False`, the loop is terminated. The `while` loop is different from the `for` loop in that it will keep looping until its condition evaluates to `False`, so it can run many times and is not limited by the number of items in a collection.\n","\n","Just like in a `for` loop, we can put any code we want inside a `while` loop, including conditionals and other loops. For example:\n","\n","#### (U) Infinite Loops\n","\n","Use caution when writing `while` loops. Since a `while` loop will continue until its Boolean expression evaluates to `False`, it is possible for a loop to continue forever. Infinite loops usually break your script, and should be avoided. The `while` loop example below will execute infinitely, because its condition will always evaluate to `True`. We didn't put this in a code cell because running it could cause your notebook to freeze!\n","\n","```python\n","while 1 > 0:\n","    print('I am running!')\n","```\n","\n","If you end up running an infinite loop in your notebook, you'll need to manually interrupt the process. The \"Interrupt\" option in the notebook's \"Kernel\" menu will attempt to interrupt any ongoing Python operations. If this option does not work, try using \"Restart.\" This will restart the kernel and halt the execution of your loop. \n","\n","> NOTE: Restarting your kernel wipes all variables from memory, so you will need to rerun any cells you need starting from the top of the notebook.\n","\n","### (U) Break and Continue\n","\n","#### References:\n","* [TutorialsPoint: Python break, continue and pass Statements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loop_control.htm)\n","\n","The `break` statement terminates the first `for` or `while` loop it is nested under. Programmers sometimes put a `break` statement in `while` loops they are developing to make sure they don't run infinitely. But `break` statements are useful in other cases too, such as terminating a `for` loop if a certain condition is met. The graphic below illustrates how the `break` statement affects the flow of your code.\n","\n","Break is effective when you are only looking for a certain number of things, and you don't know how long it will take to find them. The `for` loop below will hit the `break` statement after it finds 2 items that meet the criteria, breaking it out of the loop and skipping the rest of the IDs.\n","\n","Another flow control statement is `continue`. It skips any code following it in the `for` or `while` loop that contains it, and begins the next loop iteration. This is similar to `break`, but instead of terminating the entire loop it just terminates the current iteration of the loop and the loop continues to execute. The graphic below illustrates how the `continue` statement affects the flow of your code.\n","\n","![](GRAPHICS/Continue.png)\n","\n","The `continue` statement, like `break`, can only affect `while` and `for` loops. The `continue` statement is useful when you want to skip items in a collection that meet certain criteria.\n","\n","\n","#### Additional Notes \n","Temporary Variables\n","\n","Python `for` loops require us to define a temporary variable to store each element from our sequence as it iterates through. We saw this above with `num`. Temporary variable names follow the same naming conventions as normal Python variables, and you can name them whatever you want. Just like with other variables, it helps to choose descriptive temporary variable names. You can put any code you want in a `for` loop's indented space, including conditionals and other `for` loops.\n","\n","\n","Looping Through Other Collections\n","\n","We can use a `for` loop on any collection we've learned about so far, including dictionaries.

The lesson today will cover the Counter object, which provides a tool for counting items in a sequence. The `Counter` object is an extension of a Python dictionary. The use of the Counter object works well with all of the functions discussed in working with dictionaries, e.g., `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`, to look at the contents of a `Counter` object. Let's import the tool into our script.\n","\n","| Syntax                 | Description                               |\n","|:----------------------:|-------------------------------------------|\n","| `Counter(seq)`     | Creates a dict-like object where keys are each unique item in the<br> sequence `seq` and values are number of occurences of each item |\n","| `c.most_common(n)`     | Returns the most common `n` elements and their counts from Counter `c` |\n","\n","However there are some other ways to count within python that don't involve using specified functions. \n","\"+=\"\n","\n","Previously, we learned about operators in Python, who can tell me what type of operators there are?\n","\n","Assignment operators aid in developing counter objects that are used in conjuction with loops and conditional statements.

Looping through dictionaries with `.items()`\n","\n","Looping through dictionaries is less straightforward than looping through other collections because dictionary items are not just singular data points. Each item in a dictionary consists of a key and value. There are a few different ways to loop through dictionaries, but the most helpful way is to use `.items()`. The `.items()` method works a lot like the `.keys()` and `.values()` methods we learned about in Lesson 3, but provides both the keys and the values. Using `.items()` allows us to store two temporary variables at the same time, one for the key and one for the value.\n","\n","| Syntax               | Description                               |\n","|:----------------------:|-------------------------------------------|\n","|`for key, val in my_dict.items():`| Allows you to loop through `my_dict`, storing each entry's key in `key` and value in `val`|\n","\n","#### (U) 2.6.1.4.

Say you have a large list of coordinates like the one below that shows where targeted cell phones have been used, and we want to find most frequented locations. In other words, what sets of coordinates appear the most?\n","\n","We first need to initialize a new dictionary to hold our counts. Then, the logic put simply is: for each item in the list, 1) if the item is NOT in the dictionary yet, set the item as a key in a new dictionary entry with the value `1`; 2) if the item is already in the dictionary, add `1` to its current value.\n","\n","#### (U) 2.6.1.5. For loops with the `range()` function\n","\n","The `range()` function generates an immutable sequence of numbers which can be used as an iterable in a `for` loop. It is similar a list or tuple, but is advantageous in that no matter the size of the sequence it only requires a small amount of memory to store the start, stop, and step size of the range. The function can take up to three integers for arguments as shown below.\n","```\n","```python\n","range(start, stop, step)\n","```\n","| Arguemnt               | Description                               |\n","|:----------------------:|-------------------------------------------|\n","|start| integer starting from which the sequence of integers is to be returned|\n","|stop| integer before which the sequence of integers is to be returned.

This connection is sometimes called a _file stream_. The primary argument `open()` takes is a string: the location of the file you want to connect to. Once a file stream is opened, it must be closed for the file to be saved and accessed later. Python can connect to a file in various modes, the most basic of which are `'r'` (read mode) and `'w'` (write mode). \n","\n","read\n","\n","* To read a file, mode is `'r'` and the method is `.read()`. (This is the default mode, so if you don't pass a `mode` argument, the mode is `'r'`.)\n","\n","#### Read a Text File\n","Let's read in Kermit the Frog's Resume from the file in the location below and print it to the screen.

Luckily, we don't have to remember to close the file if we use the `with` and `as` keywords to store the file stream in a temporary variable. Our code to read or write data is indented under the `with` statement, and the file will close automatically when the indented code runs. \n","\n","Below is an example of what a  with open() block looks like. \n","\n","python\n","with open('path/folder/filename.ext') as f:\n","    variable_name = f.read()\n","<br>\n","\n","Note the slashes (`/`) separating the words in the `open()` function's argument. By default, Python will look for files in your current working folderâ€”the folder where your script or notebook is stored. If you want to read or write to a file in a different folder, you must include a _path_ to that folder. Most of the time, you'll use what's called the _relative path_. The relative path tells Python all the steps to take to get from the current working folder to the destination folder.

Started by Wes McKinney in 2008 out of a need for a powerful and flexible quantitative analysis tool, pandas has grown into one of the most popular Python libraries. It has an extremely active community of contributors.\n","\n","Pandas is built on top of two core Python libraries—matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code. For instance, pandas' .plot() combines multiple matplotlib methods into a single method, enabling you to plot a chart in a few lines.\n","\n","Before pandas, most analysts used Python for data munging and preparation, and then switched to a more domain specific language like R for the rest of their workflow.

If you are not familiar with pandas, we recommend taking a quick look at its Getting started documentation before proceeding.\n","\n","The core data structure in GeoPandas is the geopandas.GeoDataFrame, a subclass of pandas.DataFrame, that can store geometry columns and perform spatial operations. The geopandas.GeoSeries, a subclass of pandas.Series, handles the geometries. Therefore, your GeoDataFrame is a combination of pandas.Series, with traditional data (numerical, boolean, text etc.), and geopandas.GeoSeries, with geometries (points, polygons etc.). You can have as many columns with geometries as you wish; there’s no limit typical for desktop GIS software.\n","\n","geodataframe schema\n","Each GeoSeries can contain any geometry type (you can even mix them within a single array) and has a GeoSeries.crs attribute, which stores information about the projection (CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System). Therefore, each GeoSeries in a GeoDataFrame can be in a different projection, allowing you to have, for example, multiple versions (different projections) of the same geometry.\n","\n","Only one GeoSeries in a GeoDataFrame is considered the active geometry, which means that all geometric operations applied to a GeoDataFrame operate on this active column\n","\n","<a id=\"MatPlot\"></a>\n","### MatPlotLib\n","\n","Getting to Know APIs\n","API stands for application programming interface. In essence, an API acts as a communication layer, or as the name says, an interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what each other does.\n","\n","APIs can come in many forms or shapes. They can be operating system APIs, used for actions like turning on your camera and audio for joining a Zoom call. Or they can be web APIs, used for web-focused actions such as liking images on your Instagram or fetching the latest tweets.\n","\n","No matter the type, all APIs function mostly the same way. You usually make a request for information or data, and the API returns a response with what you requested. For example, every time you open Twitter or scroll down your Instagram feed, you’re basically making a request to the API behind that app and getting a response in return. This is also known as calling an API.\n","\n","SOAP vs REST vs GraphQL\n","Even though some of the examples mentioned above are geared toward newer platforms or apps, web APIs have been around for quite a long time. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, two different design models became the norm in exposing data publicly:\n","\n","SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is typically associated with the enterprise world, has a stricter contract-based usage, and is mostly designed around actions.\n","REST (Representational State Transfer) is typically used for public APIs and is ideal for fetching data from the web. It’s much lighter and closer to the HTTP specification than SOAP.\n","Nowadays, there’s a new kid in town: GraphQL. Created by Facebook, GraphQL is a very flexible query language for APIs, where the clients decide exactly what they want to fetch from the server instead of the server deciding what to send.\n","\n","! pip install [package] dog. map box\n","\n","<a id=\"Index\"></a>\n","#### Course Index\n","[Module One](#Module1) ------------>[Basic](#Basics)------------>[Data Types](#DataTypes)------------>[Operators](#Operators)------------>[Functions](#Functions)------------>[Common Ops](#CommonOps)------------>[Errors](#Errors) <br><br>\n","[Module Two](#Module2) ---------> [Ordered Data Structures](#2.1)---------> [Lists](#Lists)--------->[Tuples](#Tuples)--------->[Arrays](#Arrays)--------->[Unordered Data Structures](#2.2)--------->[Sets](#Sets) ---------> [Dictionaries](#Dictionaries)--------->[Common Oper. on Data Structures](#CommonOpsDS)--------->[Conditional Statements](#CS)--------->[Loops](#Loops) <br><br>\n","[Module Three](#Module3)------------> [File-Based TEXT](#Text)------------>[File-Based CSV](#CSV)------------>[Internet Data Sources](#JSON) ------------>[APIs](#APIs)------------>[Pandas](#Pandas)------------>[MatPlotLib](#MatPlotLib)<br><br>\n","[Module Four](#Module4)<br><br>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"esriNotebookRuntime":{"notebookRuntimeName":"ArcGIS Notebook Python 3 Standard","notebookRuntimeVersion":"7.0"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
